Here's the full implementation plan covering every gap in the platform, organized by priority:

Phase 0 — Critical (Functional Completeness & Demoability)
1. Fix Missing Product Images (6 products)
Add Unsplash thumbnail and gallery images for: Canvas Tote Bag, Ceramic Coffee Mug, Medusa Hoodie, Medusa T-Shirt, Stainless Steel Water Bottle, Wireless Earbuds.

2. Store-Facing API Routes for 21 Missing Verticals
These verticals have backend models + admin APIs but no customer-facing store routes:

Auctions, Rentals, Classifieds, Digital Products, Freelance, Travel, Social Commerce, Crowdfunding, Automotive, Grocery, Warranties
Healthcare (partial), Education (partial), Real Estate (partial), Restaurants (partial)
Fitness, Legal, Charity, Government, Parking, Utilities, Pet Services
Financial Products, Advertising (read-only), Affiliates (read-only)
Each gets at minimum: GET /store/<vertical> (list) and GET /store/<vertical>/:id (detail).

3. Seed Data for All Vertical Modules
Every one of the 40+ vertical tables currently has 0 rows. Need 3-10 representative records per module with realistic data, properly linked to existing tenants, nodes, and vendors. Includes:

Restaurants (menus, items, reservations)
Healthcare (practitioners, appointments)
Education (courses, lessons, enrollments)
Real Estate (property listings, viewings)
Event Ticketing (events, venues, ticket types)
Auctions, Rentals, Classifieds, Digital Products
Travel, Fitness, Legal, Charity, Government, Parking, Pet Services, Utilities
Financial Products, Advertising, Affiliates, Crowdfunding, Social Commerce, Grocery, Automotive, Freelance, Memberships, Warranties
4. Frontend Pages for 27 Missing Verticals
Each vertical needs at minimum a listing page and a detail page. These will be built under /$tenant/$locale/<vertical>/ routes:

Consumer Services: Healthcare, Education, Fitness, Legal, Pet Services
Marketplace: Auctions, Rentals, Classifieds, Digital Products, Freelance
Food & Retail: Restaurants, Grocery
Property & Transport: Real Estate, Travel, Parking, Automotive
Community: Charity, Crowdfunding, Social Commerce, Government, Utilities
Events & Entertainment: Event Ticketing
Finance & Protection: Financial Products, Memberships, Warranties, Advertising, Affiliates
Phase 1 — High Priority (Navigation & UX)
5. Global Mega-Menu Navigation
Replace the simple navbar with a grouped mega-menu so users can discover all verticals:

Group verticals into categories (Shopping, Services, Property, Community, etc.)
Mobile drawer with collapsible vertical groups
Navbar category images replaced with real product photos
6. Homepage Overhaul
Replace placeholder hero images with real visuals
Add a "Discover Services" grid/tile section linking to all verticals
Each vertical tile gets an icon and short description
Remove the current link-dump format, replace with visual cards
7. Branding Update
Replace "Bloom" with "Dakkah CityOS" throughout (navbar, footer, page titles, meta tags)
Update page title and favicon
Update footer description and links
Phase 2 — Medium Priority (Localization & Polish)
8. i18n Translation Files
Create translation JSON catalogs for all 3 locales (en, fr, ar)
Wire the existing locale context to load translations
Cover: navigation labels, common UI text, form labels, error messages, vertical names
Validate RTL layout applies correctly when Arabic locale is selected
9. Design System Token Integration
Map existing Tailwind classes to design token values from the cityos-design-tokens package
Wire the ThemeProvider from cityos-design-runtime into the storefront
Apply tokens to core shared components (buttons, cards, forms, inputs)
10. Admin UI Vertical Pages
Ensure Medusa Admin dashboard has widgets/pages for managing vertical module data
Currently only API routes exist for admin — add admin UI widgets where needed
Phase 3 — Nice-to-Have (Advanced Features)
11. Product Gallery Image Linking
Ensure all products have multiple gallery images properly linked (not just thumbnails)
Add image zoom/lightbox on product detail pages
12. Advanced Search Across Verticals
Extend the existing search page to include results from all verticals (not just products)
Add filters by vertical type
13. Theme Switcher & Tenant Branding
Enable per-tenant theme overrides using the design system
Light/dark mode toggle
Tenant-specific logo and color scheme support
14. Newsletter & Social Features
Wire newsletter subscription to an actual service
Social sharing buttons on product/vertical pages
Social commerce features (live streams, group buys)
Summary of Scope
Area	Current	Gap
Backend Models	191 models, 48 modules	All complete
Admin API Routes	All 48 verticals covered	Complete
Store API Routes	19 verticals	21 missing
Seed Data	Core commerce only	40+ vertical tables empty
Product Images	7/13 have thumbnails	6 products missing images
Frontend Pages	Core commerce + 8 verticals	27 verticals have zero pages
Navigation	Basic shop + account	No vertical discovery
Branding	Says "Bloom"	Should be "Dakkah CityOS"
i18n	Plumbing exists	No translation files
Design Tokens	Packages exist	Not wired into storefront
This is a very large scope. Would you like me to start implementing from Phase 0, or would you prefer to focus on specific parts first? I'd recommend starting with the product images fix (quick win), then tackling the seed data and store APIs together, followed by the frontend vertical pages.
