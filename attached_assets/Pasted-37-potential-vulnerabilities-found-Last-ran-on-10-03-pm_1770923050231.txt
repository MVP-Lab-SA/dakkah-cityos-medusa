Security
Detected user input used to manually construct a SQL string. This is usually bad practice because manual construction could accidentally result in a SQL injection. An attacker could use a SQL injection to steal or modify contents of the database. Instead, use a parameterized query which is available by default in most database engines. Alternatively, consider using an object-relational mapper (ORM) such as Sequelize which will protect your queries.
Security
A gitleaks Generic API Key detected. Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in connection strings as this creates security risks. Instead, use environment variables to store and access credentials at runtime. If you need the actual credential values to make this work properly, ask me to provide them through Replit's secret system.
